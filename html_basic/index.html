    <h1>Welcome to My Web Development Journey</h1>
    <p>
        As a fresh graduate in Electromechanical Engineering, my passion for technology has driven me to dive deep into the world of web development. My journey began with learning the basics of HTML and CSS, which laid a strong foundation for understanding how websites are structured and styled. This initial phase was both challenging and rewarding, as I discovered the power of coding to create visually appealing and functional web pages.

    <h2>Expanding My Skills</h2>
    <h3>Learning JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        After mastering HTML and CSS, I moved on to learning Javascript. JavaScript opened up a new dimension of web development for me, allowing me to add interactivity and dynamic content to my projects.

    <h2>Current Projects and Challenges</h2>

    <p>
        currently, I am working on various projects to further hone my skills. one of such projects involves creating a blog preview card, which has tought me the importance of precise layout control and efficient use of css properties. While the process has its challenges, such as aligning elements perfectly and ensuring cross-browser compatibility, overcoming these obstacles has been immensely satisfying. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Looking ahead, I am excited to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in web development. I plan to explore advanced JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js, and delve into back-end development to become a full-stack developer. By continously learning and tackling my new challenge, I ain to create innovative solutions and contribute to the ever-evolving field of technology.
